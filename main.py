    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. 
    This tool is designed for farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts to ensure healthy plants and crops.

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!
                
    The prediction can be done for any of these crops: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry (including sour), Corn (maize), Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper, bell, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato.        
    Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    #### About Our Data
    Our model was built on a dataset which consists of about 87,000 images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized different classes.The total data is split into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
    A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
    #### Content
    1. The training set contains 70295 images
    2. Test set contains 33 images
    3. Validation set has 17572 images
